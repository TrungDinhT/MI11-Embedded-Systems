Scheduling simulation, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
- Number of context switches :  6
- Number of preemptions :  0

- Thread component response time computed from simulation : 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 9/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 5/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 14/worst 
- No deadline missed in the computed scheduling : the thread component is schedulable if you computed the simulation on the hyperperiod.



Scheduling feasibility, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 24 (see [18], page 5). 
- 1 units of time are unused in the hyperperiod.
- Processor utilization factor with deadline is 0.95833 (see [1], page 6). 
- Processor utilization factor with period is 0.95833 (see [1], page 6). 
- In the non preemptive case, with EDF, the thread component set is not schedulable because one or many thread components doesn't/don't satisfy the processor utilization factor feasibility test (see [8]).
  List of thread components not schedulable : top.impl.taches.t3 

2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Worst case thread component response time : 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 21,  missed its deadline (deadline =  12)
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 5
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 42,  missed its deadline (deadline =  24)
- Some thread component deadlines will be missed : the thread component set is not schedulable.
