Scheduling simulation, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
- Number of context switches :  103
- Number of preemptions :  20

- Thread component response time computed from simulation : 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 14/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 1/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 3/worst 
- No deadline missed in the computed scheduling : the thread component is schedulable if you computed the simulation on the hyperperiod.



Scheduling feasibility, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 290 (see [18], page 5). 
- 104 units of time are unused in the hyperperiod.
- Processor utilization factor with deadline is 0.64138 (see [1], page 6). 
- Processor utilization factor with period is 0.64138 (see [1], page 6). 
- In the preemptive case, with RM, the thread component set is schedulable because the processor utilization factor 0.64138 is equal or less than 0.77976 (see [1], page 16, theorem 8). 


2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Worst case thread component response time :  (see [2], page 3, equation 4). 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 14
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 3
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 1
- All thread component deadlines will be met : the thread component set is schedulable.
