Scheduling simulation, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
- Number of context switches :  7
- Number of preemptions :  1

- Thread component response time computed from simulation : 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 7/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 3/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 23/worst 
- No deadline missed in the computed scheduling : the thread component is schedulable if you computed the simulation on the hyperperiod.



Scheduling feasibility, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 24 (see [18], page 5). 
- 1 units of time are unused in the hyperperiod.
- Processor utilization factor with deadline is 0.95833 (see [1], page 6). 
- Processor utilization factor with period is 0.95833 (see [1], page 6). 
- In the preemptive case, with EDF, the thread component set is schedulable because the processor utilization factor 0.95833 is equal or less than 1.00000 (see [1], page 8, theorem 2). 


2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Worst case thread component response time : 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 11
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 5
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 23
- All thread component deadlines will be met : the thread component set is schedulable.
