Scheduling simulation, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
- Number of context switches :  8
- Number of preemptions :  1

- Thread component response time computed from simulation : 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 7/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 3/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 23/worst 
    top.impl.taches.ta1 => 17/worst 
    top.impl.taches.ta2 => 0/worst ,  response time not computed since the thread component did not run all its compute execution time
- One or several tasks did not complete their execution : for those tasks, it is not possible to say if their deadline can be missed or not.


Scheduling feasibility, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 0 (see [18], page 5). 
- Thread components must be periodic : can not compute hyperperiod with this thread component set. 
- Thread components must be periodic : can not compute bound on processor utilization factor with period on this thread component set. 
- Thread components must be periodic : can not compute bound on processor utilization factor with period on this thread component set. 
- Task with non zero start time : can not compute processor utilization factor  with this task set.

2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Thread components must be periodic : can not compute bound on response time with this thread component set.
