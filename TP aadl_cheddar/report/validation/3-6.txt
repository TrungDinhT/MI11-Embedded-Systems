Scheduling feasibility, Processor component health_monitor.impl.cpu_a : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 20 (see [18], page 5). 
- 0 units of time are unused in the hyperperiod.
- Processor utilization factor with deadline is 1.00000 (see [1], page 6). 
- Processor utilization factor with period is 1.00000 (see [1], page 6). 
- Invalid scheduler : can not compute bound on processor utilization factor. 

2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Worst case thread component response time :  (see [2], page 3, equation 4). 
    health_monitor.impl.appli.getecg => 20
    health_monitor.impl.appli.getso2 => 4
    health_monitor.impl.appli.getpa => 2
- All thread component deadlines will be met : the thread component set is schedulable.



Scheduling feasibility, Processor component health_monitor.impl.cpu_b : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 6 (see [18], page 5). 
- 0 units of time are unused in the hyperperiod.
- Processor utilization factor with deadline is 1.00000 (see [1], page 6). 
- Processor utilization factor with period is 1.00000 (see [1], page 6). 
- Invalid scheduler : can not compute bound on processor utilization factor. 

2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Worst case thread component response time :  (see [2], page 3, equation 4). 
    health_monitor.impl.applib.check => 6
    health_monitor.impl.applib.dpy => 1
- All thread component deadlines will be met : the thread component set is schedulable.
