Scheduling simulation, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
- Number of context switches :  73
- Number of preemptions :  0

- Thread component response time computed from simulation : 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 10/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 7/worst ,  missed its deadline (absolute deadline =  10 ; completion time =  11),  missed its deadline (absolute deadline =  35 ; completion time =  37),  missed its deadline (absolute deadline =  65 ; completion time =  66),  missed its deadline (absolute deadline =  180 ; completion time =  182),  missed its deadline (absolute deadline =  210 ; completion time =  211),  missed its deadline (absolute deadline =  240 ; completion time =  241),  missed its deadline (absolute deadline =  270 ; completion time =  271)
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 10/worst 
- Some thread component deadlines will be missed : the thread component set is not schedulable.



Scheduling feasibility, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 290 (see [18], page 5). 
- 104 units of time are unused in the hyperperiod.
- Processor utilization factor with deadline is 0.64138 (see [1], page 6). 
- Processor utilization factor with period is 0.64138 (see [1], page 6). 
- In the non preemptive case, with RM, we can not prove that thread components are schedulable because one or many thread components doesn't/don't satisfy the processor utilization factor feasibility test (see [3]).
  List of concerned thread components : top.impl.taches.t2 top.impl.taches.t3 

2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Worst case thread component response time :  (see [1], page 36, equation 13). 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 10
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 10
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 7,  missed its deadline (deadline =  5)
- Some thread component deadlines will be missed : the thread component set is not schedulable.
