Scheduling simulation, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
- Number of context switches :  32
- Number of preemptions :  3

- Thread component response time computed from simulation : 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 9/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 5/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 26/worst ,  missed its deadline (absolute deadline =  48 ; completion time =  50),  missed its deadline (absolute deadline =  72 ; completion time =  73)
    top.impl.taches.ta1 => 17/worst 
    top.impl.taches.ta2 => 24/worst 
- Some thread component deadlines will be missed : the thread component set is not schedulable.



Scheduling feasibility, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 0 (see [18], page 5). 
- Thread components must be periodic : can not compute hyperperiod with this thread component set. 
- Thread components must be periodic : can not compute bound on processor utilization factor with period on this thread component set. 
- Thread components must be periodic : can not compute bound on processor utilization factor with period on this thread component set. 
- Task with non zero start time : can not compute processor utilization factor  with this task set.

2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Thread components must be periodic : can not compute bound on response time with this thread component set.
