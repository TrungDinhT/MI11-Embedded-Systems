Scheduling feasibility, Processor component health_monitor.impl.cpu_a : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 15 (see [18], page 5). 
- 0 units of time are unused in the hyperperiod.
- Processor utilization factor with deadline is 1.46667 (see [1], page 6). 
- Processor utilization factor with period is 1.46667 (see [1], page 6). 
- In the preemptive case, with RM, we can not prove that the thread component set is schedulable because the processor utilization factor 1.46667 is more than 0.77976 (see [1], page 16, theorem 8). 


2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Processor utilization exceeded : can not compute bound on response time with this thread component set. 


Scheduling feasibility, Processor component health_monitor.impl.cpu_b : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 60 (see [18], page 5). 
- 14 units of time are unused in the hyperperiod.
- Processor utilization factor with deadline is 0.76667 (see [1], page 6). 
- Processor utilization factor with period is 0.76667 (see [1], page 6). 
- In the preemptive case, with RM, the thread component set is schedulable because the processor utilization factor 0.76667 is equal or less than 0.82843 (see [1], page 16, theorem 8). 


2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Worst case thread component response time :  (see [2], page 3, equation 4). 
    health_monitor.impl.applib.getecg => 6
    health_monitor.impl.applib.check => 4
- All thread component deadlines will be met : the thread component set is schedulable.
