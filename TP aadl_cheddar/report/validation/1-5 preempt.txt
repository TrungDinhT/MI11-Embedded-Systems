Scheduling simulation, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
- Number of context switches :  11
- Number of preemptions :  2

- Thread component response time computed from simulation : 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 30/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 3/worst 
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 5/worst 
- No deadline missed in the computed scheduling : the thread component is schedulable if you computed the simulation on the hyperperiod.



Scheduling feasibility, Processor component top.impl.cpu : 
1) Feasibility test based on the processor utilization factor : 

- The hyperperiod is 30 (see [18], page 5). 
- 0 units of time are unused in the hyperperiod.
- Processor utilization factor with deadline is 1.00000 (see [1], page 6). 
- Processor utilization factor with period is 1.00000 (see [1], page 6). 
- In the preemptive case, with RM, the thread component set is schedulable because the processor utilization factor 1.00000 is equal or less than 1.00000 (see [19], page 13).


2) Feasibility test based on worst case thread component response time : 

- Worst case thread component response time :  (see [2], page 3, equation 4). 
    top.impl.taches.t1 => 30
    top.impl.taches.t3 => 5
    top.impl.taches.t2 => 3
- All thread component deadlines will be met : the thread component set is schedulable.
